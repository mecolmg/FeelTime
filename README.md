# FeelTime

This piece provides an opportunity to visualize and
auralize the vibrant colors and sounds of human emotions.
Two displays show vibrant patterns and visualizations
representing each of the other viewers observed emotions,
and plays audio to stimulate and emphasize the emotions
portrayed.

### Installation
